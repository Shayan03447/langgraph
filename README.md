# LangGraph – Practical Workflow Examples 🚀

This repository is a **hands-on collection of LangGraph workflows**, created to demonstrate **all core LangGraph concepts** using **short, real-world examples**.

Instead of theory-heavy demos, this repo focuses on **practical implementations** that clearly show **how and why** different LangGraph workflows are used in real AI systems.

---

## 🔍 What This Repository Covers

This project covers the **most important LangGraph patterns**, including:

- ✅ Conditional Workflows  
- ✅ Parallel Workflows  
- ✅ Iterative (Loop-based) Workflows  
- ✅ Graph-based state management  
- ✅ Node routing & decision making  

Each example is intentionally kept **small, readable, and reusable** so the core concept is easy to understand.
